    <p>
      I'm returning to UT Austin after 5 years for my final two semesters.
    </p>

    <p>
      I withdrew in 2021 as a junior because I was frustrated with the curriculum
      of the classes I was taking. I felt like I was wasting my time learning
      irrelevant material, especially during a period of life with many
      extracurricular opportunities. I also knew that UT allows for up to a
      10 year gap, so if I ever wanted to come back and graduate within a year,
      I could.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm now married and looking for a stable career path, so I'm diving back
      into student life in the hopes of landing a job offer by the time I
      graduate.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm in this class because I want to learn C++ and become familiar with
      standard design patterns in many production codebases. I'm rusty when it
      comes to writing C / C++. I've used them before, but it's been a few years.
      I'm excited to jump back in with a new perspective.
    </p>

    <p>
      The lectures so far have been engaging, especially with the hour-long class
      times and cold calling. I enjoy that things feel fast-paced,
      conversational, and that the notes are made public as a single text file.
    </p>

    <h3>Pick of the week</h3>

    <p>
      <a href="https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.6"><strong>Bun 1.3.6</strong></a>
    </p>

    <p>
      People love to criticize JavaScript, but it's a great language for general
      purpose coding. Specifically, the modern ES module syntax is very
      ergonomic, and the npm package ecosystem is hard to compete with.
    </p>

    <p>
      BunJS is a modern javascript runtime written in Zig that has a very
      developer-friendly standard library, is compatible with most NodeJS and
      Web APIs, and is surprisingly performant.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have been using Bun for my projects for years, and I highly recommend
      giving it a try if you use NodeJS or if you're interested in learning
      JavaScript.
    </p>

    <p>
      This week, Bun 1.3.6 came out, which
      <a href="https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.6#files-in-bun-build">
        finally supports building virtual files
      </a>.
      This is something I've hacked around before by writing tons of temporary
      files during my build process. With built-in virtual file support, I'll be
      able to refactor some of my build processes.
